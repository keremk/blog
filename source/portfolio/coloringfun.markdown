## Coloring Fun
### Introduction
Coloring Fun is a color book application for children. It features 12 professionally designed drawings, including teddy bear, bicycle, boat, snowman that every kid would enjoy. Scrollable color wheel contains kid-friendly bright colors and makes color selection intuitive and easy. Touch and fill function creates professional looking paintings every time.

Besides entertainment, the app provides educational value by spelling out the names of each drawing when pressed on it. You can also save each drawing to the photo gallery by pressing the camera button in the app. Shaking the phone erases the drawing, and shaking it again will undo the erase.

By using the Coloring Fun app, your kid will be able to create master pieces that they will be proud of! They will also improve their spelling while they are having fun painting!
